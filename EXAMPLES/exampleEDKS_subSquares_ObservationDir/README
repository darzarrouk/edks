setup the required data in EDKSsubParams.py
then execute calcGreenFunctions_EDKS_subTriangles.py 

each matrix is G_{Nobs}x{Ntriangles}

the order of columns and rows follows the same order as the input files specified in EDKSsubParams

SS : rake = 0 (left lateral)
DS : rake = 90 (updip)


IMPORTANT: !!!!!

     ITO data has some specific directions, so i saved 2 GF matrices (G_SS_proj.txt and G_DS_proj.txt) that are the projected GFs into the direction of the measured displacement. So use this two (G_SS_proj.txt and G_DS_proj.txt) to fit the ITO measurements.
