Dear Junle, 

Thank you for your interest. 
I'm sending our data, which are already published in GRL. 
As mentioned in my GRL paper,  the observation error of the horizontal displacements at TJT1 and TJT2 is 20 m although that of the vertical displacement is less than 50 cm. 
So, be careful if you use those. 

TJT1_OBP    143:47.7516 38:12.5681  5 m uplift
TJT1_ OBS1 143:47.0288 38:12.6599 62 m  N98E
TJT1_OBS2  143:47.0696 38:12.6663 53 m  N81E
TJT2_OBS1   143:39.3655 38:12.8064 91 m N138E 
TJT2_OBS2 143:39.3340 38:12.7759 78 m N135E
TJT2_OBP 143:39.4328 38:12.6943 52 m N104E

The data of GJT3 are are submitted by Kido et al.
I believe that it will be open in the near future.

Best, 
Yoshi

2011_11_18: Things I did to the original data files.

awk '{print $1, $2 + $3/60.0, $4 + $5/60.0, $6*100.0, $7}' ITO_disp.dat  > ITO_idLonLat.dat

Then edit ITO_idLonLat.dat to replace the direction with a unit vector pointing in such a direction.
